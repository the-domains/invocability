**My first Destiny Skill is Live**

This little skill is made so I can improve Alexa's ability to recognize the weird item names in Destiny. Just repeat after Alexa and I'll get the data to improve future skills.

You can enable it [here][0].

If you don't have an Alexa device you can use one of the many iOS or android emulator apps or head over to [echoism][1]. If you already have the Amazon app hitting the microphone speaker at the top will open up Alexa. You can also try one of the many options on the Google Play store or App Store. I have been successful with the iOS "Swift" app, but Reverb has not worked.

**How to use it:**

After you enable it in the app (or by saying "Alexa, enable Destiny Item Names") open it with "Alexa, open Destiny Item Names".

The skill is now open and you no longer have to preface requests with the Alexa wake word.

Alexa will greet you with a welcome message, listen to it to learn how to use the skill.

When you are ready to start helping out tell Alexa "I'm ready", "Continue" or something similar.

You will be prompted with an item name. If you can't hear it Alexa will repeat it after a few seconds or you can view the text in the Alexa phone app or the web app [here][2].

Repeat what you heard/read to Alexa. It will be logged for later analysis. You can continue for as long as you like, when you are done just say "Stop".
